# Game-of-LAIFE
LAIFE (Learned Artificial Intelligence Forecasting Evolution)


## `Project`

The aim of this project is to create a simple example to explain Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Step 1

Teach to a CNN how to play Game of Life (GoL) in a supervised way. The AI plays a role as a transition matrix between steps of GoL.

## Step 2

As before but unsupervised. Loss based on entropy and penalty for non-exploding behaviour.

## Step 3

Implement new rules, gloabl rules with masked MLP or local one with other convolutional layers.

## Step 4

More dimensions!
